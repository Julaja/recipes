# recipes
This is a collection of some of my cooking recipes and the recipe code
generator that is still work in progress. It's not meant for public use (yet?),
but I wanted to consolidate all the many formats of recipes I had collected
over the time.

## Dependencies
Python3 and mako.

## Preview
You can view a very simple rendering [at the Github pages for this project](https://johndoe31415.github.io/recipes/).
